# Modelproject

In this project we are solving the Cournot model for a duopoly, also called Cournot competition, that is a model of imperfect competition between 2 firms that choose their production considering the otherâ€™s choice. We show how the model is solved, achieving the Reaction Functions for each firm and, consequently, finding the optimal price of the market and outputs. The idea was to simulate the different applications of this important economic theory, from linear demands for identical firms that produce homogeneous products until more complex cases.
